								<h2></h2>
								<h3>
								Currently, I'm focused on advancing my career as a User Experience Designer, and the Advanced <br>
								Diploma program at Georgian College in Toronto plays a crucial role in enhancing my knowledge <br>
								of human-computer interaction. I'm passionate about designing with purpose, weaving human <br>
								elements into interfaces, and refining interactions to flow as naturally as everyday gestures.</h3>
								<br>
								
								<h3>Background</h3>
								For as long as I can remember, I've been curious and fascinated by how people perceive and interact<br>
								with the world around them. This curiosity led me to study psychology and cognitive science, delving<br>
								into the intricacies of human perception, cognition, and ultimately, human-computer interaction.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h3>Design Approach</h3>
							
								<p>My journey has shaped my design approach to prioritize reducing users' cognitive load. In a world<br>
								where we deal with numerous products daily, the last thing I want is to add another obstacle. Instead,<br>
								I aim to create inviting experiences that encourage users to explore more deeply without feeling <br>
								disoriented from the start.</p>
								
								<p>One aspect of design that captivates me is how small details can subtly influence people's experiences.<br>
								It's not just about aesthetics; it's about achieving that perfect balance where everything fits seamlessly.<br>
								That's why I enjoy creating playful micro-animations, refining animations to achieve ideal fluidity,<br>
								and humanizing interactions to reflect genuine human intentions. Consider this: often, it's the little <br>
								things that brighten your day!</p>
								
								<p>At the core of my work is empathy. Remembering that there's a complex and unique individual on the other<br>
								side of the screen inspires me to adopt a multi-layered design approach. My goal is to create products that<br>
								bring satisfaction to people and seamlessly integrate into their daily lives.</p>

								<h3>Passions</h3>
								<p>I find inspiration in the world around me. I love exploring new cultures through travel, which often influences<br>
									 my design decisions. When I'm not creating, you can find me cycling, playing tennis, or playing with my dog <br>
									 Shamira. I also have a special appreciation for pizza, but then again, who doesn't?" :)</p>
